# NAME

Acme::Author::RSRCHBOY::TravisTinkering - The great new Acme::Author::RSRCHBOY::TravisTinkering!

# VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of Acme::Author::RSRCHBOY::TravisTinkering - released April 21, 2015 as part of Acme-Author-RSRCHBOY-TravisTinkering.

# SYNOPSIS

    What are you even thinking, using this.

# DESCRIPTION

This will never, ever be released to the CPAN.  (I think)  It's just a scratch
project designed to allow me to tinker with Travis CI builds w/o constantly
trying things out in a "travis/tinkering" branch of a real project.

Please note **I do not expect to be gittip'ed or flattr'ed for this work**,
rather **it is simply a very pleasant surprise**. I largely create and release
works like this because I need them or I find it enjoyable; however, don't let
that stop you if you feel like it ;)
