=head1 SYNOPSIS

    What are you even thinking, using this.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This will never, ever be released to the CPAN.  (I think)  It's just a scratch
project designed to allow me to tinker with Travis CI builds w/o constantly
trying things out in a "travis/tinkering" branch of a real project.
